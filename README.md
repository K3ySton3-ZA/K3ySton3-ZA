Hi there! I'm Mayan, but I go by K3ySton3 on the Internet. I'm just your friendly neighbourhood cyber spook. 

What gets me going? Solving the riddles of cyber warfare, navigating the intricacies of international security & risk management, and decoding the ever-evolving landscapes of geopolitics and cyber threats. I am driven by a passion for knowledge and a curiosity for how the world works.

By day I find myself responding to incidents and exploring the complex cyber landscape. My research work can be found on my [website](https://mayanstegmann.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mayan-stegmann) profile.
