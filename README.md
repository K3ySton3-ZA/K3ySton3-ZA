Hi there! I'm Mayan, but I go by K3ySton3 on the Internet. I'm just your friendly neighbourhood cyber spook. 

What gets me going? Solving the riddles of cyber warfare, navigating the intricacies of international security & risk management, and decoding the ever-evolving landscapes of geopolitics and cyber threats. I am driven by a passion for knowledge and a curiosity for how the world works.
